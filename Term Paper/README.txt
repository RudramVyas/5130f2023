This paper addresses the challenges of web data management in the context of the ever-expanding web. Ensuring data quality, privacy, and security is of paramount importance in this environment. Furthermore, the integration of web data from various sources presents a significant challenge, necessitating effective data extraction methods. In response to these challenges, this paper offers a comprehensive exploration of solutions, ranging from web scraping techniques to data cleaning and preprocessing methods. It also delves into the various storage models, such as traditional relational databases and NoSQL systems, and discusses the role of semantic web technologies and linked data in organizing and accessing web information.
